# Pollution level detector

## Try it: https://pollutionlevels.netlify.app/

Welcome!

This app will help you detect pollution in cities.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This app uses the Lodash function get.
* npm
```
npm i --save lodash.get
```

### Usage

The usage is really straightforward.

When you first open the application, it'll ask for your current position; that's because it'll try to detect pollution in your current area.

If you don't want to give your position, it's fine: just enter a city name in the form and you are good.


## The results

After a city is correctly submitted, on the right of the form you'll find a widget with the name of the location you choose and a number.

That number is the Air Quality Index, provided by "[The World Air Quality Project](https://aqicn.org/map/world/)".

For more detailed information about the AQI values, you can check out [this page](https://aqicn.org/scale/).
